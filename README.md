As part of the team working with Alphabet Soup, my task is to develop a machine learning tool that can assist in selecting applicants with the highest potential for success in their ventures to receive funding from the foundation. Leveraging my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will create a binary classifier using the provided dataset's features to predict the likelihood of applicants being successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team at Alphabet Soup has provided me with a CSV file containing data on over 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding from the foundation. This dataset includes various columns that capture essential metadata about each organization, helping us analyze and make predictions about their potential success.
